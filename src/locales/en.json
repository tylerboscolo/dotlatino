        "question": "What is .latino?",
        "answer": ".latino is a new top-level domain (TLD) created specifically for the global Latino community. Just like .com or .org, it's the ending of a web address — but .latino instantly signals cultural identity, heritage, and community connection. Whether you're a business owner, creator, nonprofit, or individual, .latino gives you a digital home that represents who you are."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who can register a .latino domain?",
        "answer": "Anyone! .latino is open to individuals, businesses, organizations, and creators worldwide who identify with or serve the Latino community. There are no geographic restrictions — whether you're in Los Angeles, Mexico City, São Paulo, or Madrid, .latino is for you."
      },
      {
        "question": "When will .latino domains be available?",
        "answer": "We're currently in the pre-launch phase. Registration will open in stages — beginning with a Trademark Sunrise period for brand owners, followed by Early Access, Limited Registration, and finally General Availability for everyone. Sign up for notifications to be the first to know when each phase opens."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much will a .latino domain cost?",
        "answer": "Pricing will vary by registrar and registration phase. Early access periods may carry premium pricing, while General Availability will offer standard market rates. Sign up for our mailing list to receive pricing details as soon as they're announced."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is .latino different from .lat?",
        "answer": "Great question. While .lat serves the broader Latin American region as a geographic identifier, .latino is designed specifically for the global Latino community and diaspora — including the 63 million+ Latinos in the United States, communities across Latin America, and Latinos everywhere in the world. It's about cultural identity, not just geography."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use .latino for a website in any language?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. While .latino celebrates Latino heritage, your website can be in any language — English, Spanish, Portuguese, or any other. The domain represents cultural identity and community, not a language restriction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will .latino domains include HTTPS security?",
        "answer": "Yes. All .latino domains support modern HTTPS encryption standards. Your website will be secure and trusted from day one — no extra setup or hidden fees required for basic SSL/TLS protection."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where will I be able to register a .latino domain?",
        "answer": "When registration opens, .latino domains will be available through major accredited registrars including GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, and others. Check back here or sign up for notifications to stay updated on partner availability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I transfer an existing website to a .latino domain?",
        "answer": "Once .latino is live, you'll be able to register a .latino domain and point it to your existing website, or transfer your site to the new domain. Standard DNS configuration and domain transfer processes will apply through your registrar."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who operates the .latino registry?",
